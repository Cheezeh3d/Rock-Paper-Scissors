# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This was a quick little game I needed to make for the Odin Project
using JavaScript within a website. It lacks any sort of user interface,
but we were told to worry about that for a later lesson, and to mainly
just focus on the fundamental functions that will make the game work.
The game runs fine (even if the code is a little messy), and I actually
want to see if there is a way in the future to minimize the comparison
function a little bit more. Using six different if/else-if statements to
compare two variables seems like work I should be able to slim down a bit.
Oh well, that's a future problem.
